  * The pattern component implements the inheritance hierarchy used
  * for regular expressions. It defines the abstract superclass for a Pattern
  * as well as different concrete subclasses for represent various parts of
  * regular expression syntax.
  * The starter includes a partial implementaton for the pattern component.
  * It defines the   pattern superclass, along with a few functions that serve
  * as methods for the class. It also includes concrete implementations of pattern
  * for matching individual symbols (SymbolPattern) and for matching concatenated
  * patterns (BinaryPattern). As you add support for different regular expression
  * syntax, you'll create new struct and function definitions in the pattern
  * implementation file, exposing prototypes (and comments) for their constructors
  * in the header.
